#   QUICKSTART   #
##################

Welcome to the cnv_benchmark project!
The following lists a few important functionalities of this
package to get you started.

General Information
###################

# import cnv_benchmark as cnvb
cnvb.__version__



The DataLoader
##############

# import
from cnv_benchmark import DataLoader

# Q: But what do we do now?
# A: Maybe ask for help?

# --> get an overview of all the Classes methods available
Dataloader().help()

# the "classmethod" is used for the initialization of the Class

# We can however get an overview of all available datasets with the following
Dataloader.available_datasets()

# then choose a dataset and initialize the Class
dataset = Dataloader.fetch_data("group_dataset")

# now you can use the other methods to get the information about the data and/or load the data as pathlib.Path or as pd.Dataframe
# this is packaged as a dictionary for clarity and a structured handling of information
